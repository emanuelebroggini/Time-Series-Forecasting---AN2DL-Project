# Time-Series-Forecasting---AN2DL-Project
A project focused on developing a forecasting model capable of predicting multiple uncorrelated time series while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across different time domains. The primary challenge was to create a model that could transcend domain-specific constraints, a crucial aspect for real-world applicability.
